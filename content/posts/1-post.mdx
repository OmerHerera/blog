title: How I learn to test global environments

What I learn this week,

When doing `unit-test` sometimes we need to mock the window object or the `process.env` if you are testings in nodejs

Lets said you have some code like this:

```js
    function getParam() {
        const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
        return urlParams.get('value') === '1';
}
```

If you are using [jest](https://jestjs.io/), how you can mock the query from the URL it `Jest` its running on node(no window ðŸ˜”)

I found that in `Jest` its possible to set any query param in the URL using the following code

```js
    beforeAll(() => {
    window.history.pushState({}, null, '?value=1');
});
// now you can check your code
it('should return 1 from query', () => {
    expect(getParam().toEqual('1')
});
```

Another useful code that I discover is mocking `process` environments in node

Again lets said you have the following code,
```js
    function isLogLevelError() {
        return process.env.LOG_LEVEL = 'ERROR';
}
```

And you want to test the how your code will behave according to this environment

```js
beforeAll(() => {
    process.env.LOG_LEVEL = 'ERROR';
});

// now you can check your code
it('should return 1 from query', () => {
    expect(isLogLevelError().toEqual('ERROR')
});
```
