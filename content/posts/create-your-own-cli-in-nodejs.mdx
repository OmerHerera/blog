In this post, I'll try to explain how you can create your own `cli` command line in nodejs.

### Step 1 - Create a Node module
- Create a folder structure something like this:

```
    my-cool-cli-project
    |_ bin\cli.js
    |_ package.json
```
<br />

- Run `yarn init` or `npm init` - Following the instruction 🚶

### Step 2 - Create a command-line script
- Create a JavaScript file and name it `cli.js`
- Convert the file into a command-line script
    - We want to make our file executable
    - We do this adding [shebang character sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) at the very top of our JavaScript file:
    ```
        #!/usr/bin/env node
    ```
    We are telling *nix systems that the interpreter of our JavaScript file should be `/usr/bin/env node` which looks up for the locally-installed `node` executable.

    In Windows, that line will just be ignored because it will be interpreted as a comment, but it has to be there because npm will read it on a Windows machine when the NodeJS command-line package is being installed.

- Make our JavaScript command-line file executable
    - We need to modify its file permissions. In a *nix system you can do that as follows:

    ```
    chmod +x cli.js           # Make the file executable
   ```

- Add code to our JavaScript command-line file

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const [,, ...args] = process.argv;
console.log(`Hello ${args}`);

```
<br />

### Step 3 - Map a command-line script to a command name

- Lets gave a more meaningful mane to our command lien that doesn't need to be the file name

- Add a `bin` filed in your `package.json` which is a mans of command name to local file name:

```json
"bin": {
    "my-cool-cli": "./bin/cli.js"
}
```

### Step 4 - Test your cli

- Now that we finished all the heavy lifting 😁 lets test itt
- Run `yarn link` or `npm link` now our command has been `symlinked globally`
- Now we can execute our file:
    ```
    > my-cool-cli
    Hello
    > my-cool-cli omher
    Hello Omher
    ```

- Don't forget to run once you finish `yarn unlink` or `npm unlink`


That's it in 4 steps you can create your own cli mode and run on Linux or Mac 🎉
