If you want to test your package installs the right way without publishing, check out using `yarn pack`or
`npm pack` to package up your module into a
`tgz`file and then install that file with `yarn add` or
`npm install` . Itâ€™s basically what
`yarn/npm` does with your package under the hood ðŸ¤¯

```js
# Pack your module into a .tgz :package:
yarn pack
# Navigate into another project
cd ../another-project
yarn add ../my-lib/my-lib-1.0.0.tgz
# or
npm install ../my-lib/my-lib-1.0.0.tgz
# ðŸ’¥ Your module it's installed
```
