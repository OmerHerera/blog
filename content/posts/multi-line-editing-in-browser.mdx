I'm sure to happen to you, you want to test some JavaScript code in the browser(but its more that one line, 
maybe a function), if you go to the browser console you will get the following experience:

<br />

Usually, what I do, I go codeSandBox and run my code.

If you are using Firefox you can do the following:
